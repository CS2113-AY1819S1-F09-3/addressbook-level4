== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to import/export guests using CSV files*
** What it does: Allows users to export and import guests using CSV files. For unsuccessful imports, an import report window will be generated to show the offending section of data and its associated issues.
** Justification: The import feature is critical to the application because it allows event planners to save time by adding guests in batches. The export feature also allows event planners to share guest data easily.
** Highlights: This enhancement is designed to support future file formats easily. This required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.

* *Minor enhancement*: added utility class to generate QR codes
