Invités is a desktop application that helps people to organize and manage events. It simplifies and streamlines common event management tasks such as managing a guest list, attendance taking, QR code ticketing and mass email sending. With our application, event planners are able save time and effort as it offers a much more beginner friendly and specialized workflow as compared to its competition such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheet. It is also designed to be highly versatile and can be used to plan and manage a wide range of events from school camps to weddings.

The application is developed in Java and has a graphical user interface created with JavaFX.

Invités is developed as part of a team project for a software development module in National University of Singapore. I was tasked with the responsibility to implement a data sharing mechanism for the guest data. Below is a breakdown of our various roles in the team, which consists of five members.

== Summary of contributions

|_This section summarizes my main contributions to the team. It showcases my ability to develop software features and work on software as a team._

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability share data by importing/exporting guests to Comma Separated Values(CSV) files*
** What it does: Allows event planners to export/import guests along with their details to CSV files. For unsuccessful imports, an import report window will be generated to show the malformed data and its associated errors.
** Justification: The import feature is critical to the application because it allows event planners to save time by adding guests in batches. The export feature also allows event planners to share guest data easily.
** Highlights: This enhancement is designed to support future file formats easily and it required an in-depth analysis of several design alternatives.
