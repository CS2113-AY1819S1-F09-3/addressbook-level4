== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 4

---

== Overview

//Add application details

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the event details component*
** What it does: allows the user to enter the confirmed details for the event they are organising with the help of our application.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to view specific details that they need to prioritise in the days leading up to the event.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects the existing logic, model, ui and storage components as it involves the creation of a new model class, the add_event and delete_event commands.
** Credits: Reused some ideas from the SE-EDU AddressBook Level 4 model component

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a stackpane to the status bar footer to display a countdown to the user's event. This serves as a reminder of the user's deadline.
