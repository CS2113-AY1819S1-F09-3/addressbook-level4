== PROJECT: Invités
== Introduction
|===
|_The purpose of this portfolio is to document my contributions, both technical and documentation-wise, to the project Invités._
|===

Invités is a desktop application to help event managers and planners better organise and manage large events.
Moreover, the application can mainly be controlled by a 3rd party using the Command Line Interface,
as well as a User Interface.

Invités was developed as part of team my team's Software Engineering Project, and some of its main features the ability to
send mass emails, keep track of payments, as well as the tab keeping of attendance of the guests. To add to this, by
using a standardised format, the application is able to take in Comma Separated Values (CSV) files and import
data for a particular event. The team that worked with me on this project, as well as the features they implemented,
as listed below:

1. Aaryam Srivastava - Mass Emailing
2. Sandhya Gopakumar - Events Creation
3. Sarah Taaher Bonna - Data Filtering
4. Tan Tze Guang - Attendance Taking
5. Tan Wei Ming - Data Importation

inform all of their guests at once, regarding details of the event or otherwise.
