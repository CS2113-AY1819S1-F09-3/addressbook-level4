== PROJECT: Invités
== Introduction
|===
|*_Preface:_* The purpose of this portfolio is to document my contributions, both technical and documentation-wise, to my software engineering project Invités.
|===

Invités is a desktop application to help event managers and planners better organise and manage large events.
Moreover, the application can mainly be controlled by a 3rd party using the Command Line Interface,
as well as a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

                                                                    Moreover, the application can mainly be controlled by a 3rd party using the Command Line Interface,
                                                                    as well as a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

    Thanks to the complementary features our group implemented, we are able to
                                                   create a streamlined workflow for event planners and managers
                                                   in all facets, as depicted in *Diagram 1* on the left.

*My contribution* involved implementing the mass-emailing functionality in our product, which allows you to send emails to individual, or
all of your guests. An added feature of ticket generation is also available, whereby you may send guests their tickets for the event,
and hence streamline the attendance taking of your event simultaneously. This feature is extremely crucial as it allows event managers to
quickly inform all of their guests in a swift and efficient manner, and eliminates the need of individually sending emails, a process that
can become tedious and ineffective. Moreover, the ticket generation will not only ease the process of attending taking, but also provide an
environmentally-friendly alternative to printing tickets, posters, flyers, and banners for an event.

Finally, the team that worked with me on this project, as well as the features they implemented,
are listed below:

1. Sandhya Gopakumar - Events management
2. Sarah Taaher Bonna - Guest list management
3. Tan Tze Guang - Attendance management
4. Tan Wei Ming - Data sharing

== Summary of contributions
|===
| *_Preface:_* The purpose of this section is to list the contributions I have made to project Invités
|===

* *Main Feature*: added the ability to *send mass emails* to guests
** What it does: allows you to either send emails to individual guests using the command `email`, or
send mass emails using the `emailAll` and `emailSpecific` commands.
** Justification: This feature will allow event managers to streamline their event notification process and
inform all of their guests at once, regarding details of the event or otherwise. Furthermore, ticket generation provides users a
digitised and economical solution for attendance taking once the event goes live.
