== PROJECT: Invités
== Introduction
|===
|*_Preface:_*
|The purpose of this portfolio is to document my contributions, both technical and documentation-wise, to my software engineering project Invités.
|===

Invités is a desktop application to help event managers and planners better organise and manage large events.
Moreover, the application can mainly be controlled by a 3rd party using the Command Line Interface,
as well as a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Invités was developed as part of team my team's Software Engineering Project, and some of its main features the ability to
send mass emails, keep track of payments, as well as the tab keeping of attendance of the guests. To add to this, by
using a standardised format, the application is able to take in Comma Separated Values (CSV) files and import
data for a particular event.

| image:ProductWorkflow.png[] Diagram 1 - Product Workflow | Thanks to the complementary features our group implemented, we are able to
                                                   create a streamlined workflow for event planners and managers
                                                   in all facets, as depicted in *Diagram 1* on the left.

*My Contribution*

I was responsible for implementing the mass-emailing functionality in our product, which allows you to send emails to individual, or
all of your guests. An added feature of ticket generation is also available, whereby you may send guests their tickets for the event,
and hence streamline the attendance taking of your event simultaneously.


Finally, the team that worked with me on this project, as well as the features they implemented,
as listed below:

1. Aaryam Srivastava - Mass Emailing
2. Sandhya Gopakumar - Events Creation
3. Sarah Taaher Bonna - Data Filtering
4. Tan Tze Guang - Attendance Taking
5. Tan Wei Ming - Data Importation

== Summary of contributions
|===
|*_Preface:_*
|The purpose of this section is to list the contributions I have made to project Invités
|===

* *Main Feature*: added the ability to *send mass emails* to guests
** What it does: allows you to either send emails to individual guests using `email`, or
send mass emails to all your guests or certain groups of guests using `emailAll` and `emailSpecific` respectively
** Justification: This feature will allow event managers to streamline their event notification process, as they can easily and quickly
inform all of their guests at once, regarding details of the event or otherwise.
