//Add in team details
== Overview

Invités - An event management system. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to filter data*
** What it does: allows the user to filter data based on keywords provided by user, such as .
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can find people who have yet to pay or are absent on the day of the event.
                  This will help users to be able to find people that fit the conditions they are looking for, without having to traverse the list manually.

* *Minor enhancement*: modified find command that allows the user to find guests with the name(s), phone number(s) and/or email address(es)
                       so that the user can find a group of people at one go, instead of doing it one-by-one.
