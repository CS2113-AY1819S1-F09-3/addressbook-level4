== Introduction

Invités is an application targeted at event managers and planners. The application allows its users to efficiently organise, cater, and manage large events such as weddings, school gatherings, orientation camps, etc. Some of the main features include the ability to send mass emails, keep track of payments, and take note of attendance of the guests. To add to these features, by employing a standardised format, the application is able to take in Comma Separated Values (CSV) files and import the guest list for a particular event. This eliminates the need to key in the guest details manually and subsequently, gives users an alternative if they decide to organise another event using the same guest list.
This guide provides information that will help you get started as a contributor to this project. If you are already a contributor to the project, you will find it useful to refer to this guide.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, please go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete_guest 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete_guest 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `EventDetailsPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a guest) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
.Structure of the Model Component following OOP
image:ModelComponentClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter feature
==== Current Implementation

The filter mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook`
will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `filter t/vegan pa/paid` command to obtain a list of people
who are Vegan *and* have paid.
The `filter` command calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

.Filter Sequence Diagram
image::FilterSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How filter executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User has to include prefixes when using
filter command.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `t/`, just search through the tags field directly).
** Cons: We must ensure that the user includes the prefix of each
individual keywords and check that the prefixes are correct.

* **Alternative 2:** User just enters keywords without prefixes.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues (e.g. to find guests with a particular tag,
the application will have to go through the payment and attendance fields, before going
through the tag field).
// end::filter[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find feature
==== Current Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook`
will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `find n/Alex p/92743824 e/johndoe@gmail.com` command to obtain
a list of people who have the name `Alex`, phone number `92743824` *or* email address
`johndoe@gmail.com`.
The `find` command calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

.Find Sequence Diagram
image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How find executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User has to include prefixes when using
find command.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `e/`, just search through the email field directly).
** Cons: We must ensure that the user includes the prefix of each
         individual keywords and check that the prefixes are correct.
* **Alternative 2:** User just enters keywords without prefixes.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues (e.g. to find a guest
 with a particular email address, the application will have to
 go through the name and phone number fields, before going through the email field).
// end::find[]

// tag::event[]
=== Add/Delete Event feature
==== Current Implementation

The add_event and delete_event mechanisms are facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add_event and delete_event mechanisms behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `add_event n/Wedding d/18/10/2019 v/Mandarin Hotel st/10:00 AM t/ClassicTheme` command to add in details about the event they are currently organising.
The `add_event` command calls `Model#addEvent()` to add in the event details.
It calls 'Model#commitAddressBook()' which saves the modified state of the address book after the command executes in the `addressBookStateList`.
The `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If the user has added in the details of the event they are organising, then another set of event details should not be stored.
The `add_event` command uses `Model#hasEvent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user.

Step 3. After the event has taken place, the user decides to organise another event with the same guest list and deletes the event details using the 'delete_event' command.
The `delete_event` command calls `Model#deleteEvent` to delete the event's details.
The command also calls Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If the user has not added in the details of an event, then there are no specific event details to delete.
The `delete_event` command uses `Model#hasEvent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add_event operation works:

.Sequence diagram for add_event command that adds event details.
image::AddEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800" ]

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete_event operation works:

.Sequence diagram for delete_event command that deletes event details.
image::DeleteEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800" ]

==== Design considerations
===== Aspect: Creation of the Event component
*** Alternative 1(current choice): Create an 'Event' with date, name, start time, venue and tag attributes and an aggregation association with 'AddressBook' wherein 'AddressBook' contains an 'Event' object.
** Pros: It is easier to use and test.
** Cons: The user can only organise 1 event at a time.

*** Alternative 2: Create an 'Event' having an aggregation association with 'VersionableAddressBook'. Create an 'InvitesBook' having an aggregation association with 'Event'.
** Pros: It allows the user to organise multiple events and manage multiple event-specific guest lists.
** Cons: The 'undo' and 'redo' commands are affected.

=== Edit Event feature
==== Current Implementation

The edit_event mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit_event mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `add_event n/Wedding d/8/12/2019 v/Hilton st/10:00 AM` command to add in details about the event they are currently organising.

Step 3. Due to a sudden change of plans, the user wishes to change the event's date and venue.
The user executes 'edit_event d/10/12/2019 v/Novotel' command. The 'edit_event' command calls `Model#updateEvent' to update the event's details.
The command also calls Model#commitAddressBook()` which saves the modified address book state into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If the user has not added in the details of an event, then there are no specific event details to edit.
The `edit_event` command uses `Model#hasEvent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit_event operation works:

.Sequence diagram for edit_event command that edits the event details
image::EditEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::event[]

// tag::emailimplementation[]
=== Email Functionality

==== High Level Algorithm Design
The email functionality, comprising of the commands `email`, `emailAll`, and `emailSpecific`, allows the user to send individual and mass emails to their guests.
Moreover, all three commands will open a popup window to prompt the user to enter their relevant details, namely their email address and password,
as well as the email subject and message. Currently `Gmail` is the only supported domain for the user's email address, however the implementation of this function
easily allows for more domains to be supported.

Additionally, the *main location of the email functionality's implementation* resides within the *Logic* component, with an additional *UI* component to allow the user to input their details.

.EmailAll Class Diagram
image::EmailAllClassDiagram.png[width="700"]

The figure above captures the main interactions between all classes when the user executes an `emailAll` command.

    * The command depends on the class `EmailPasswordAuthenticator` for verification of the user's email credentials and the abstract class `Email`. The `Email` class creates the email object to be sent, as well as establishes a connection with Gmail's SMTP server via `Properties`.
    * Moreover, the creation of the UI window is facilitated by the class `EmailWindow`, which also returns the email data once you input your details.
    * Furthermore, the email object is created thanks to the `MimeMultiPart` class, and comprises of two main parts:
    ** The first part is the text input the user provided in the UI window, which is used by `MimeMessage` and `MimeBodyPart`, both of which implement the interface `MimePart`.
    ** The second part is the QR code which acts as the guest's ticket and is generated by `QrUtil`. Note that currently only the `email` command generates the QR code.
    * Finally, the email, with all its contents, is sent via the abstract class `Transport`.

==== Command Mechanism
.MailCommand Activity Diagram
image::MailCommandActivityDiagram.png[width="700"]

The figure above represents an activity diagram when the user executes the _email_ command. As you can see, the command involves *error checking*, followed by *creating an email object*, and finally *sending* this email to an individual guest. Furthermore, this procedure follows the interactions described earlier.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Creating an EmailWindow for user input
*** Current choice: Creating the UI component directly from the abstract class Email.
** Pros: Reduces dependencies with other UI components and increases cohesion with Email class.
** Cons: Does not use a controller to create the UI component, it is called directly from logic component Email.

*** Alternative: Create a controller for showing `EmailWindow`.
** Pros: Will fit with the software architecture of the codebase.
** Cons: Current model will have to be changed to allow feed back of user input.

===== Aspect: Implementing email verification of guest email addresses
*** Current choice: Email addresses are only checked for validity, not whether they exist.
** Pros: Efficient way to send mass emails without slowing down the program for verification.
** Cons: User will be unaware if the guest email address does not exist, which may affect communication.

*** Alternative: Implement email validation for all possible email domains.
** Pros: User is able to check which guest email addresses do not exist.
** Cons: Would make the codebase bulkier and require multiple email domain configurations.

// end::emailimplementation[]

// tag::importexport[]

=== Import/Export Command
==== Current Implementation

===== High level overview of the class hierarchy
The import and export command enables batch importation and exportation of people into and out of the guest list. Additionally, the import command will create a popup window to show the errors during import only if there are any. The commands currently only support comma-separated value file format (CSV), however, it is designed to easily support other formats such as VCard in the future.

The implementation of the import and export feature mainly resides under the logic component of the application. The import command involves an additional user interface (UI) component that shows import errors.

The Import/Export feature is facilitated by the `AdaptedPerson`,`PersonConverter` and `SupportedFile` interfaces. They provide the behaviour specifications so that the Import/Export command will be able to operate without knowing the underlying implementations.

* `AdaptedPerson` represents a person in the respective file format. It requires the following method.
** `AdaptedPerson#getFormattedString()`: returns the string representation of the person according to the particular file format.
* `SupportedFile` represents a supported file that is able to read and write `AdaptedPerson` s' to the actual file on the computer.  Here are some of its key methods
** `SupportedFile#readAdaptedPersons()`: Returns all person in the form of `AdaptedPerson` s from the file
** `SupportedFile#writeAdaptedPersons()`: Writes all `AdaptedPerson` to the file
* `PersonConverter` represents a person converter that is able to convert between `Person` s and `AdaptedPerson` s. Here are some of its key methods.
** `PersonConverter#encodePerson()`: Encodes a `Person` object and returns the corresponding `AdaptedPerson` object
** `PersonConverter#decodePerson()`: Decodes an `AdaptedPerson`  object and returns corresponding `Person` object

To support the import/export of CSV files, `CsvAdaptedPerson`,`CsvPersonConverter` and `CsvFile` implements the above mentioned interfaces.

For the import command, the popup window to show errors encountered is facilitated by the `ImportError` and `ImportReportWindow` classes.

* `ImportError` represents an error encountered during the import command. It stores the actual CSV formatted person and its associated error message.
* `ImportReportError` is the controller class of the popup window that will display all `ImportError` s encountered during the execution of an import command.

The following class diagrams shows the relationship between the classes and interfaces mentioned above.

.Import/Export Command Class Diagram
image::ImportExportClassDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

===== Command mechanism

The import command will first read the csv file and loop through all the guest data and add them into the model. When application encounters a particular guest in CSV file which fails to be converted or is already an existing guest, an `ImportError` will be created. These `ImportError` object will be added in a list within the import command.

After the command completes the importation of all guests in the guest list, if there are unsuccessful imports, it will trigger a `ShowImportReportEvent` which will display the errors

The following sequence diagram shows how the Import operation works:

.Import Command Sequence Diagram
image::ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

The `ShowImportReportEvent` will be handled by the `MainWindow` according to the following sequence diagram below.

.Import Report Window Sequence Diagram
image::ImportReportWindowSequenceDiagram.png[width="500"]

'''

The export command will only export the currently filtered guest list by calling `Model#getFilteredPersonList`. This enables greater flexibility as it provides a way for users to select specific groups of people to export. The following sequence diagram shows how the export operation works:

.Export Command Sequence Diagram
image::ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Implementing decoding/encoding functionality in Import/Export command

*** Alternative 1 (current choice): import & export command be able to do accept a general `PersonConverter`
** Pros: Reduction in code duplication when supporting other file-formats in the future. Easier to mock and do unit tests.
** Cons: More complicated to implement.

*** Alternative 2: Each supported format has its own command which knows how to do the required conversion
** Pros: We do not need to check for the required import/export format required.
** Cons: Higher testing overhead for possible numerous types of export & import command. Duplicated boilerplate code.

=====  Aspect: Implementing the reading/writing of file functionality in Import/Export command

*** Alternative 1: Abstract the writing/reading of files into separate classes, `SupportedFile` interface and `CsvFile` class (current choice)
** Pros: Able to add support for other file formats with changing existing code.
** Cons: Increased code complexity.

*** Alternative 2: Use a utility class with static methods
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: Violates open-close principle. Code will only work for CSV files. High coupling with the import/export command. Impossible to mock, decreases the testability of the import/export commands.

// end::importexport[]

// tag::markunmark[]
=== Mark/Unmark Command
The mark/unmark mechanism is facilitated by `Model`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mark/unmark command executes at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state and the currentStatePointer pointing to that single address book state.

Step 2. The user executes the command `import guestlist.csv` to import a list of guest and add them to the current state of the `AddressBook`.

[NOTE]
Alternatively, the user can execute the command `add_guest n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@gmail.com pa/PAID a/ABSENT u/00001 t/NORMAL` to create an instance of one guest and add them to the current state of `AddressBook`.

Step 3. The user will execute the command `mark 00001` to set the attendance of the `Person` to `PRESENT`.

Step 4. An instance of `getPersonList` is retrieved from the `model` using `MODEL#getAddressBook#getPersonList`. A linear search is then executed on the `getPersonList` to find a `Person` with the same Unique ID (UID) as `00001`.

[NOTE]
If there is no matching UID found, a `COMMANDEXCEPTION` will be thrown to indicate nobody in the list has the phone number.
If there is more than one instance of the same UID, a `COMMANDEXCEPTION` will be thrown to indicate that there are more than one instance of the same UID. In this case, `edit_guest` will not work. The user has to delete the entry and `add_guest` for the deleted entry.

Step 5. After retrieving the information from the discovered `Person`, another `Person` is created with the same fields with the exception of the attendance field being changed from `ABSENT` to `PRESENT`.

Step 6. Finally, the entry is updated using `MODEL#updatePerson` to transfer the new information into the `Model` before `commitAddressBook` is executed to save the state of the `AddressBook`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `mark` operation works:

.Mark Command Sequence Diagram
image::MarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following sequence diagram shows how the `ummark` operation works:

.Unmark Command Sequence Diagram
image::UnmarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How mark/unmark executes

*** Alternative 1 (current choice): access the `PersonList` model to execute marking of attendance.
** Pros: Able to mark the attendance of anybody within the list even when it is filtered. Prevents the bug of a person filtering the list to only show a single instance of the multiple similar UID to mark their attendance.
** Cons: Some changes might be hard to detect when displaying a filtered list.

*** Alternative 2: access the `filteredPersonList` model to execute the marking of attendance.
** Pros: Able to work with a smaller set of people in the list. Changes made are immediately observable.
** Cons: Introduces bugs such as avoiding the similar UID check within the current instance of the guest list. If the filtered list does not immediately have the UID that needs to be used, the user has to call `list` command first. Increasing the chance of human error in the system.

// end::markunmark[]

// tag::generateuid[]

=== Extension made to add_guest: Generate Unique ID (UID) on creation of an entry into the list
This feature is facilitated by the usage of the `Model`. +
Given below is an example of the execution of the added functionality of the `add_guest` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state and the currentStatePointer pointing to that single address book state.

Step 2. The user executes the `add_guest` command with the following non-null fields: `add_guest n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@gmail.com pa/PAID a/ABSENT u/00000 t/NORMAL`.

Step 3. The `addCommandParser` extracts the relevant information from the command and returns a `Person` model that was built with the given arguments.

Step 4. The `add_guest.execute` function receives the generated `Person` model and checks for duplicates of the same `Person` as well as duplicates of the same `UID` in the `VersionedAddressBook`.

[NOTE]
If the checks fail, `COMMANDEXCEPTION` will be thrown to indicate the existence of more than one of the same `UID` or `Person`

Step 5. The function will test the equality between the `UID` given in the generated `Person` and the `DEFAULT_TO_GENERATE_UID` which is `u/00000`. From here the program will do one of 2 different things.

Step 6a. If the `UID` given is not the same as `DEFAULT_TO_GENERATE_UID`: +
         The program will treat this as a user defined UID and add the `Person` into the `Model` without generating a new UID.

Step 6b. Alternatively, If the `UID` input in step 2 is the same as `DEFAULT_TO_GENERATE_UID`: +
         The program will create a new `Person` model with the same arguments with the exception of `UID`. The `UID` is then generated randomly in the `generateUid()` function.
         Another check is done to ensure that the `UID` does not already exist in the `VersionedAddressBook`.
         This is done in a loop to ensure the `UID` is unique before adding the `Person` into the `Model` by executing `addPerson()`.

Step 7. After adding the `Person` into the `Model`, the program commits the changes by executing `commitAddressBook` to save the state of the `AddressBook`..

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add_guest` command works:

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Whether to only generate UID or to allow the user to define UID

*** Alternative 1 (current choice): give the user the freedom to choose between defining their own `UID` or letting the program generate one itself.
** Pros: Able to write tests for the command that will not fail. A company or event may already be using some sort of unique identification, this can be used by the event planner to uniquely identify attendees. If there is none, the user can just let the program generate one for them.
** Cons: Increased code complexity

*** Alternative 2: only let the user define the `UID` for all attendees of the event.
** Pros: Decreased code complexity
** Cons: User will face great difficulty in creating UID for a large group of people if there is no unique identifier available for the attendees already.

*** Alternative 3: only generate the `UID` for all the attendees in the list, user input for the UID is not allowed.
** Pros: Decreased code complexity
** Cons: Unable to write meaningful tests if the the actual output is going to be random. Users may already have a way to uniquely identify the attendees to the event but the event planner cannot make use of that method.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{We plan on implementing a data encryption feature such that when the user chooses to, the data stored in the addressbook will be encrypted and display ceases to show all information.}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== [Proposed] Guest Email Verification

_{We plan on implementing a guest email verification system, that lets the user know which of their guest email addresses exist, for any email domain.}_

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
