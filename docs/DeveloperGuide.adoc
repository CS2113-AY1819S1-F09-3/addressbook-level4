== Introduction

Invités is an application targeted at event managers and planners. The application allows its users to efficiently organise, cater, and manage large events such as weddings, school gatherings, orientation camps, etc. Some of the main features include the ability to send mass emails, keep track of payments, and take note of attendance of the guests. To add to these features, by employing a standardised format, the application is able to take in Comma Separated Values (CSV) files and import the guest list for a particular event. This eliminates the need to key in the guest details manually and subsequently, gives users an alternative if they decide to organise another event using the same guest list.
This guide provides information that will help you get started as a contributor to this project. If you are already a contributor to the project, you will find it useful to refer to this guide.

== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

. *JDK `9`* or later
+
[WARNING]
JDK `10` on Windows will fail to run tests in <<UsingGradle#Running-Tests, headless mode>> due to a https://github.com/javafxports/openjdk-jfx/issues/66[JavaFX bug].
Windows developers are highly recommended to use JDK `9`.

. *IntelliJ* IDE
+
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle and JavaFx plugins installed. +
Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, please go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.


=== Setting up the project in your computer

. Fork this repo, and clone the fork to your computer
. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. Click `New...` and find the directory of the JDK
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Open a console and run the command `gradlew processResources` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew processResources`). It should finish with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. +
This will generate all resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup

. Run the `seedu.address.MainApp` and try a few commands
. <<Testing,Run the tests>> to ensure they all pass.

=== Configurations to do before writing code

==== Configuring the coding style

This project follows https://github.com/oss-generic/process/blob/master/docs/CodingStandards.adoc[oss-generic coding standards]. IntelliJ's default style is mostly compliant with ours but it uses a different import order from ours. To rectify,

. Go to `File` > `Settings...` (Windows/Linux), or `IntelliJ IDEA` > `Preferences...` (macOS)
. Select `Editor` > `Code Style` > `Java`
. Click on the `Imports` tab to set the order

* For `Class count to use import with '\*'` and `Names count to use static import with '*'`: Set to `999` to prevent IntelliJ from contracting the import statements
* For `Import Layout`: The order is `import static all other imports`, `import java.\*`, `import javax.*`, `import org.\*`, `import com.*`, `import all other imports`. Add a `<blank line>` between each `import`

Optionally, you can follow the <<UsingCheckstyle#, UsingCheckstyle.adoc>> document to configure Intellij to check style-compliance as you write code.

==== Updating documentation to match your fork

After forking the repo, the documentation will still have the SE-EDU branding and refer to the `se-edu/addressbook-level4` repo.

If you plan to develop this fork as a separate product (i.e. instead of contributing to `se-edu/addressbook-level4`), you should do the following:

. Configure the <<Docs-SiteWideDocSettings, site-wide documentation settings>> in link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`], such as the `site-name`, to suit your own project.

. Replace the URL in the attribute `repoURL` in link:{repoURL}/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[`DeveloperGuide.adoc`] and link:{repoURL}/docs/UserGuide.adoc[`UserGuide.adoc`] with the URL of your fork.

==== Setting up CI

Set up Travis to perform Continuous Integration (CI) for your fork. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to set it up.

After setting up Travis, you can optionally set up coverage reporting for your team fork (see <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Coverage reporting could be useful for a team repository that hosts the final version but it is not that useful for your personal fork.

Optionally, you can set up AppVeyor as a second CI (see <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>>).

[NOTE]
Having both Travis and AppVeyor ensures your App works on both Unix-based platforms and Windows-based platforms (Travis is Unix-based and AppVeyor is Windows-based)

==== Getting started with coding

When you are ready to start coding,

1. Get some sense of the overall design by reading <<Design-Architecture>>.
2. Take a look at <<GetStartedProgramming>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::Architecture.png[width="600"]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.pptx` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder. To update a diagram, modify the diagram in the pptx file, select the objects of the diagram, and choose `Save as picture`.

`Main` has only one class called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components. Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.

* `EventsCenter` : This class (written using https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained[Google's Event Bus library]) is used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)
* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

.Class Diagram of the Logic Component

[discrete]
==== Events-Driven nature of the design

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete_guest 1` command (part 1)
image::SDforDeletePerson.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the `Model` simply raises a `AddressBookChangedEvent` when the Address Book data are changed, instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

The diagram below shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates being saved to the hard disk and the status bar of the UI being updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time.

.Component interactions for `delete_guest 1` command (part 2)
image::SDforDeletePersonEventHandling.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `EventDetailsPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a guest) and/or raise events.
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeletePersonSdForLogic.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelComponentClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:ModelComponentClassBetterOopDiagram.png[width="800"]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in xml format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` -- Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` -- Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

image::UndoRedoStartingStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 2. The user executes `delete_guest 5` command to delete the 5th guest in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand1StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 3. The user executes `add_guest n/David ...` to add a new guest. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand2StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the guest was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

image::UndoRedoExecuteUndoStateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial address book state, then there are no previous address book states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoRedoSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

[NOTE]
If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone address book states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand3StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David ...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoNewCommand4StateListDiagram.png[width="800"]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png[width="650"]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
** Pros: Easy to implement.
** Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the guest being deleted).
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use a list to store the history of address book states.
** Pros: Easy for new Computer Science student undergraduates to understand, who are likely to be the new incoming developers of our project.
** Cons: Logic is duplicated twice. For example, when a new command is executed, we must remember to update both `HistoryManager` and `VersionedAddressBook`.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `HistoryManager` for undo/redo
** Pros: We do not need to maintain a separate list, and just reuse what is already in the codebase.
** Cons: Requires dealing with commands that have already been undone: We must remember to skip these commands. Violates Single Responsibility Principle and Separation of Concerns as `HistoryManager` now needs to do two different things.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::filter[]
=== Filter feature
==== Current Implementation

The filter mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook`
will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `filter t/vegan pa/paid` command to obtain a list of people
who are Vegan *and* have paid.
The `filter` command calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

image::FilterSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::filter[]

// tag::find[]
=== Find feature
==== Current Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook`
will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `find n/Alex p/92743824 e/johndoe@gmail.com` command to obtain
a list of people who have the name `Alex`, phone number `92743824` *or* email address
`johndoe@gmail.com`.
The `find` command calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

image::FindSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]
// end::find[]

// tag::event[]
=== Add/Delete Event feature
==== Current Implementation

The add_event and delete_event mechanisms are facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add_event and delete_event mechanisms behave at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `add_event n/Wedding d/18/10/2019 t/10AM` command to add in details about the event they are currently organising.
The `add_event` command calls `Model#addEvent()` to add in the event details.
It calls'Model#commitAddressBook()' as well, causing the modified state of the address book after the `add_event n/Wedding t/8thOct t/10AM` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`.
The `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If the user has added in the details of the event they are organising, then another set of event details should not be stored.
The `add_event` command uses `Model#hasEvent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user.

Step 3. After the event has taken place, the user decides to organise another event with the same guest list and decides to delete the event details using the 'delete_event' command.
The `delete_event` command calls `Model#deleteEvent to delete the event's details.
The command also calls Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If the user has not added in the details of an event, then there are no specific event details to delete.
The `delete_event` command uses `Model#hasEvent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add_event operation works:

image::AddDeleteEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800" ]

=== Edit Event feature
==== Current Implementation

The edit_event mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit_event mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `add_event n/Wedding d/8/12/2019 v/Hilton st/10:00 AM` command to add in details about the event they are currently organising.

Step 3. Due to a sudden change of plans, the user wishes to change the event's date and venue.
The user executes 'edit_event d/10/12/2019 v/Novotel' command. The 'edit_event' command calls `Model#updateEvent' to update the event's details.
The command also calls Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

[NOTE]
If the user has not added in the details of an event, then there are no specific event details to delete.
The `edit_event` command uses `Model#hasEvent()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit_event operation works:

image::EditEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800"]

// end::event[]

// tag::tags[]
=== Add/Remove Tag generation feature
==== Current Implementation

The addTag/removeTag mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook` as it provides an editable form of a `ReadOnlyAddressBook` provided by the `Model` interface.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

`Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`, and `Model#resetData()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addTag/removeTag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes the command `import guestlist.csv` to import a list of guests and add them to the current state of `AddressBook`.

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved.

Step 3. The user now decides to add a set of tags to all guests in the list and executes the command `addTag t/VIP t/Platinum` to add the tags `VIP` and `Platinum`.

Step 4. A `ReadOnlyAddressBook` is created and an editable address book is created using `AddressBook`. To add to this, the current filtered list is accessed using `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`

Step 5. The set of tags are added to all guests in the editable address book via `AddressBook#addTag()` and `AddressBook#addTagFromPerson()`

Step 6. Finally, `Model#resetData()` and `Model#commitAddressBook()` are called to reset the current state of the list with the updated tags.

The `removeTag` command does the opposite, and removes a set of tags from all guests in the guest list. However, the workflow is similar to `addTag`; a new `AddressBook` is created and edited accordingly as per the command.

[NOTE]
If there are no guests in the current list, or if the removeTag command tries to remove non-existent tags, the function will not execute and the current state of the list will be preserved.

The following sequence diagram summarizes how the addTag() and removeTag() function work:
The sequence diagram uses the case of addTag() to highlight how the application responds to this command. However, the same logic and sequence flow is applied to the removeTag() command.

|====

|====

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to create an EditableAddressBook for AddTag and RemoveTag?

*** Alternative 1 (current choice): edit the `AddressBook` model to allow an addTag and removeTag command to execute
** Pros: Easier to use by the functions and also to test
** Cons: Variability is difficult, as new editions to the model must be made

*** Alternative 2: Make the AddressBook editable by default
** Pros: Current AddressBook can easily be changed by any functions
** Cons: Makes the content of the AddressBook less secure by giving all functions access to edit
// end::tags[]

// tag::importexport[]

=== Import/Export Command
==== Current Implementation

The import and export command enables batch importation and exportation of people into and out of the guest list. Currently the commands only support comma-separated value file format (CSV), however, it is open for the addition of new formats.

The Import/Export features are mainly facilitated by objects of 2 classes. The `CsvFile` and `CsvConverter` objects. The following class diagram shows the relationship between the classes involved in the import/export.

image::ImportExportClassDiagram.PNG[width="800"]

The CsvConverter class enables us decode/encode between the Person class and the desired format (CSV). The CsvConverter class implements PersonConverter interface which requires the implementing class to be able to decode/encode Person objects to the desired format.

The 'CsvFile' class enables us to read and write 'AdaptedPerson' to a file. `CsvFile` Implements the `SupportedFile` class which requires it to read and write lists of `AdaptedPerson` objects.

`CsvAdaptedPerson` extends `AdaptedPerson`, it represents a guest in the respective file formats, which our case is CSV.

'''

The import command will first read the csv file and loop through all the guest data and add them into the model. Badly formatted csv lines will be skipped and the user are given feedback on the number of successful imports in the CommandResult Ui component. The following sequence diagram shows how the Import operation works:

|====
| image:ImportCommandSequenceDiagram.PNG[] | image:ImportSequenceRefFrame.PNG[]
|====

The export command will only export the currently filtered list so as to allow users to select specific groups of people. The following sequence diagram shows how the Export operation works:

|====
| image:ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.PNG[] | image:ExportSequenceRefFrame.PNG[]
|====

'''

Given below is an example usage scenario and how to support new file formats (Eg. VCard).

Step 1. Create new class to extend `AdaptedPerson` abstract class.

		Eg. VcardAdaptedPerson
		This will represent the a guest in the VCard file format.


Step 2. Create new class to implement `PersonConverter` interface. Implement the `encodePerson` and `decodePerson` method.

		Eg. VcardConverter
		The methods in this class, contains the logic to convert between the `Person` and `AdaptedPerson` objects.


Step 3. Create new class to implement `CsvFile` interface. Implement `readAdaptedPersons` and `writeAdaptedPersons`.

		Eg. VcardFile
		The above mentioned methods will allow you to interface with the underlying files.


Step 4. Add checks in the `ImportCommandParser` and `ExportCommandParser` to allow the application to call the classes that you have created.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How to implement decoding/encoding functionality in Import/Export command

*** Alternative 1 (current choice): import & export command be able to do accept a general PersonConverter
** Pros: Reduction in code duplication when supporting other file-formats in the future. Easier to mock and do unit tests.
** Cons: More complicated to implement.

*** Alternative 2: Each format has its own command which knows how to do the required conversion
** Pros: We do not need to check for the required import/export format required.
** Cons: Higher testing overhead for possible numerous types of export & import command. Duplicated boilerplate code.

=====  Aspect: How to implement the reading/writing of file functionality in Import/Export command

*** Alternative 1: Abstract the writing/reading of files into separate classes, `SupportedFile` interface and `CsvFile` class (current choice)
** Pros: Able to add support for other file formats with changing exisiting code.
** Cons: Increased code complexity.

*** Alternative 2: Use a utility class with static methods
** Pros: Simple to implement.
** Cons: Violates open-close principle. Code will only work for CSV files. Tightly coupled.

// end::importexport[]

// tag::markunmark[]
=== Mark/Unmark Command
The mark/unmark mechanism is facilitated by `Model`.
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mark/unmark command executes at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state and the currentStatePointer pointing to that single address book state.

Step 2. The user executes the command `import guestlist.csv` to import a list of guest and add them to the current state of the `AddressBook`.

[NOTE]
Alternatively, the user can execute the command `add_guest n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@gmail.com pa/PAID a/ABSENT t/NORMAL` to create an instance of one guest and add them to the current state of `AddressBook`.

Step 3. The user will execute the command `mark 98765432` to mark the attendance of the `Person`.

Step 4. An instance of `filteredPersonList` is retrieved from the `model` using `MODEL#getFliteredPersonList`. A linear search is then executed on the `filteredPersonList` to find a `Person` with the same phone number as `98765432`.

[NOTE]
If there is no matching phone number found, a `COMMANDEXCEPTION` will be thrown to indicate nobody in the list has the phone number.

Step 5. After retrieving the information from the discovered `Person`, another `Person` is created with the same fields with the exception of the attendance field being changed from `ABSENT` to `PRESENT`.

Step 6. Finally, the entry is updated using `MODEL#updatePerson` to transfer the new information into the `filteredPersonList` before `commitAddressBook` is executed to save the state of the `AddressBook`.

=== [Proposed] Data Encryption

_{We plan on implementing a data encryption feature such that when the user chooses to, the data stored in the addressbook will be encrypted and display ceases to show all information.}_

// end::dataencryption[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g App name, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Documentation

We use asciidoc for writing documentation.

[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility in formatting.

=== Editing Documentation

See <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to render `.adoc` files locally to preview the end result of your edits.
Alternatively, you can download the AsciiDoc plugin for IntelliJ, which allows you to preview the changes you have made to your `.adoc` files in real-time.

=== Publishing Documentation

See <<UsingTravis#deploying-github-pages, UsingTravis.adoc>> to learn how to deploy GitHub Pages using Travis.

=== Converting Documentation to PDF format

We use https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/[Google Chrome] for converting documentation to PDF format, as Chrome's PDF engine preserves hyperlinks used in webpages.

Here are the steps to convert the project documentation files to PDF format.

.  Follow the instructions in <<UsingGradle#rendering-asciidoc-files, UsingGradle.adoc>> to convert the AsciiDoc files in the `docs/` directory to HTML format.
.  Go to your generated HTML files in the `build/docs` folder, right click on them and select `Open with` -> `Google Chrome`.
.  Within Chrome, click on the `Print` option in Chrome's menu.
.  Set the destination to `Save as PDF`, then click `Save` to save a copy of the file in PDF format. For best results, use the settings indicated in the screenshot below.

[[Docs-SiteWideDocSettings]]
=== Site-wide Documentation Settings

The link:{repoURL}/build.gradle[`build.gradle`] file specifies some project-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how all documentation files within this project are rendered.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in the `build.gradle` file will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of site-wide attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-name`
|The name of the website.
If set, the name will be displayed near the top of the page.
|_not set_

|`site-githuburl`
|URL to the site's repository on https://github.com[GitHub].
Setting this will add a "View on GitHub" link in the navigation bar.
|_not set_

|`site-seedu`
|Define this attribute if the project is an official SE-EDU project.
This will render the SE-EDU navigation bar at the top of the page, and add some SE-EDU-specific navigation items.
|_not set_

|===

[[Docs-PerFileDocSettings]]
=== Per-file Documentation Settings

Each `.adoc` file may also specify some file-specific https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#attributes[asciidoc attributes] which affects how the file is rendered.

Asciidoctor's https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#builtin-attributes[built-in attributes] may be specified and used as well.

[TIP]
Attributes left unset in `.adoc` files will use their *default value*, if any.

[cols="1,2a,1", options="header"]
.List of per-file attributes, excluding Asciidoctor's built-in attributes
|===
|Attribute name |Description |Default value

|`site-section`
|Site section that the document belongs to.
This will cause the associated item in the navigation bar to be highlighted.
One of: `UserGuide`, `DeveloperGuide`, ``LearningOutcomes``{asterisk}, `AboutUs`, `ContactUs`

_{asterisk} Official SE-EDU projects only_
|_not set_

|`no-site-header`
|Set this attribute to remove the site navigation bar.
|_not set_

|===

=== Site Template

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/stylesheets[`docs/stylesheets`] are the https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[CSS stylesheets] of the site.
You can modify them to change some properties of the site's design.

The files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] controls the rendering of `.adoc` files into HTML5.
These template files are written in a mixture of https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] and http://slim-lang.com[Slim].

[WARNING]
====
Modifying the template files in link:{repoURL}/docs/templates[`docs/templates`] requires some knowledge and experience with Ruby and Asciidoctor's API.
You should only modify them if you need greater control over the site's layout than what stylesheets can provide.
The SE-EDU team does not provide support for modified template files.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

=== Running Tests

There are three ways to run tests.

[TIP]
The most reliable way to run tests is the 3rd one. The first two methods might fail some GUI tests due to platform/resolution-specific idiosyncrasies.

*Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner*

* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
* To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`

*Method 2: Using Gradle*

* Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean allTests`)

[NOTE]
See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> for more info on how to run tests using Gradle.

*Method 3: Using Gradle (headless)*

Thanks to the https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] library we use, our GUI tests can be run in the _headless_ mode. In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen. That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.

To run tests in headless mode, open a console and run the command `gradlew clean headless allTests` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean headless allTests`)

=== Types of tests

We have two types of tests:

.  *GUI Tests* - These are tests involving the GUI. They include,
.. _System Tests_ that test the entire App by simulating user actions on the GUI. These are in the `systemtests` package.
.. _Unit tests_ that test the individual components. These are in `seedu.address.ui` package.
.  *Non-GUI Tests* - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
..  _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. +
e.g. `seedu.address.commons.StringUtilTest`
..  _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working). +
e.g. `seedu.address.storage.StorageManagerTest`
..  Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These test are checking multiple code units as well as how the are connected together. +
e.g. `seedu.address.logic.LogicManagerTest`


=== Troubleshooting Testing
**Problem: `HelpWindowTest` fails with a `NullPointerException`.**

* Reason: One of its dependencies, `HelpWindow.html` in `src/main/resources/docs` is missing.
* Solution: Execute Gradle task `processResources`.

== Dev Ops

=== Build Automation

See <<UsingGradle#, UsingGradle.adoc>> to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

=== Continuous Integration

We use https://travis-ci.org/[Travis CI] and https://www.appveyor.com/[AppVeyor] to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects. See <<UsingTravis#, UsingTravis.adoc>> and <<UsingAppVeyor#, UsingAppVeyor.adoc>> for more details.

=== Coverage Reporting

We use https://coveralls.io/[Coveralls] to track the code coverage of our projects. See <<UsingCoveralls#, UsingCoveralls.adoc>> for more details.

=== Documentation Previews
When a pull request has changes to asciidoc files, you can use https://www.netlify.com/[Netlify] to see a preview of how the HTML version of those asciidoc files will look like when the pull request is merged. See <<UsingNetlify#, UsingNetlify.adoc>> for more details.

=== Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.

.  Update the version number in link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp.java`].
.  Generate a JAR file <<UsingGradle#creating-the-jar-file, using Gradle>>.
.  Tag the repo with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
.  https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/[Create a new release using GitHub] and upload the JAR file you created.

=== Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Address Book depends on the http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome[Jackson library] for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_ can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which is better than these alternatives. +
a. Include those libraries in the repo (this bloats the repo size) +
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)
