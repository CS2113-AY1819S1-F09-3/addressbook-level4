== Introduction
Invités is an application targeted at event managers and planners. The application allows you to efficiently *organise, cater, and manage* large events such
as weddings, school gatherings, orientation camps, etc. Some of the main features include the ability to send mass emails, keep track of payments and take note of the attendance of your guests.
To add to these features, by employing a standardised format, the application is able to take in Comma Separated Values (CSV) files and import data for a particular event.
This eliminates the need to input all the information manually and subsequently, gives you an alternative if you decide to organise another event using the same guest list.

Moreover, you will have an easier time managing the reception of your event as you will be equipped with tools that will minimise errors in catering,
organisation, and orders. Moreover, our application aims to reduce your frustration while planning events by packaging your needs in a platform that is more user friendly, personalised, and
efficient.

The main purpose of this User Guide is to give you a detailed overview of all the features in our application and how to use them.

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest jar file from the GIT repository link:https://github.com/CS2113-AY1819S1-F09-3/main[here].
.  Place the jar file where your home directory resides
.  Double click on the jar file and wait a couple of seconds as the application loads. If you're successful, a main screen will load
   similar to the one shown below:
+

.Ui Mockup of Invités
image::Ui.png[width="790"]
+
.  As the Command Line Input is your primary method of manipulation, here are some
   example commands that you can use:

* `help` : Displays a summary of the list of commands that the application offers.
* `add_guest` : Adds a guest to the guest list.
* `delete_guest` : Deletes an entry from the guest list.
* `mark` : Marks the attendance of a guest from `ABSENT` to `PRESENT`.
* `exit` : exits the application.

.  You should type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.

.  Please refer to <<Features>> subsection to see more detailed documentation of the functions that
   are included in this application
.  If you would like to perform emailing services through our application, please complete the steps as listed
   in <<Enabling Email Services>>

== FAQ

*Q*: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? +
*A*: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous guest list. +
Alternatively, you could export the data from your current computer using the export command. Using this data you can launch the application on a different computer and import the data.

*Q*: ​How do I import my existing data on a CSV into the application? +
*A*: Firstly, create a new event within the application. After this, use the import function and specify the path to the file.
You will see the guest list populate itself with the data from the specified CSV file.

// tag::settingupemail[]
== Enabling Email Services

In order for you to use the commands `email`, `emailAll`, and `emailSpecific` you must allow Invités to access your email account and
send emails. Currently, our application only supports Gmail accounts, but we do plan on supporting
other email domains.

If you do have a *Gmail* account, please follow these steps to enable email services:

1. Login to your Gmail account using your preferred online browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox).
2. Click on your profile picture on the top right, and click on `Google Account`
3. Once you are re-directed, under the `Sign-in and security` section, click on `Apps with account access`
4. Scroll down till you find the section `Allow less secure apps` on the right. Set this option to `ON`.
5. You are now ready to send emails to your guests through Invités!

[WARNING]
Currently there is no other way to enable mailing services than to let your Gmail account allow less secure apps, and hence your account may be
susceptible to an increased number of spam emails from untrusted applications. However, our team is working quickly to find a more secure replacement.

[IMPORTANT]
If your operating system is *macOS Mojave*, please make a *important* note of the following:
|====
| image:EmailWindow.png[] Figure 9 - EmailWindow | 1. If you use any of the email-related commands (i.e. _email_, _emailAll_ or _emailSpecific_), you will be presented with an EmailWindow similar to
the one in *Figure 9*.

2. If you use the *command-tab* keys when the EmailWindow is open to switch windows, this will cause the program to crash. This is due to
Apple's latest macOS release, in which some of the bindings are not compatible with key JavaFX functions.

3. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience caused, and our team is quickly trying to fix this issue.

4. This issue is not occur on Windows, Linux, and older macOS systems, however this issue _may still exist_ in other operating systems we have not tested on.
