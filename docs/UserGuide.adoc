== Introduction
Invités is an application targeted at event managers and planners. The application allows you to efficiently *organise, cater, and manage* large events such
as weddings, school gatherings, orientation camps, etc. Some of the main features include the ability to send mass emails, keep track of payments and take note of attendance of the guests.
To add to these features, by employing a standardised format, the application is able to take in Comma Separated Values (CSV) files and import data for a particular event.
This eliminates the need to input all the information manually and subsequently, gives you an alternative if you decide to organise another event using the same guest list.

This will give you an easier time while managing the reception at your event as you will be equipped with tools that will minimise errors in catering,
organisation, and orders. Moreover, this application aims to reduce your frustration while planning events by addressing your needs in a platform that is more user friendly, personalised, and
efficient.

The main purpose of this User Guide is to give you a detailed overview of all the features in our application and how to use them.

== Setting up your Gmail Account

In order for you to use the commands `email`, `emailAll`, and `forceEmail`, you must allow Invités to access your email account and
send emails. Currently, our application only supports Gmail accounts, but we do plan on supporting
other email domains.

If you do have a Gmail account, please follow these steps to enable email services:

1. Login to your Gmail account using your preferred online browser (e.g. Chrome, Firefox).
2. Click on your profile picture on the top right, and click on `Google Account`
3. Once you are re-directed, under the `Sign-in and security` section, click on `Apps with account access`
4. Scroll down till you find the section `Allow less secure apps` on the right. Set this option to `ON`.
5. In the Invités application, please specify your username and password in the file `Credentials.txt` at `/src/main/resources/EmailData/` in your project folder.
6. Please specify an email subject and message in the file `Message.txt` also at `/src/main/resources/EmailData/` in your project folder.
7. You are now ready to send emails to your guests through Invités!

[WARNING]
Currently there is no other way to enable mailing services than to let your Gmail account allow less secure apps, and hence your account may be
susceptible to an increased number of spam emails from untrusted applications. However, our team is working quickly to find a more secure replacement.
